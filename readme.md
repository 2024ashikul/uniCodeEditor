**CodeSync** is a full-featured, web-based coding laboratory designed for Computer Science students and educators. It provides a comprehensive platform for lessons, assignments, real-time collaboration, and assessments, all within a secure and controlled environment.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Role-Based Access Control:** Separate interfaces and permissions for Students, Teachers, and Admins.
* **Course Management:** Create and manage lessons, announcements, and assignments.
* **Diverse Assessments:** Supports quizzes, project-based assignments, and automated code grading.
* **Live Codecasting:** A "Lecture Mode" where instructors can code in real-time, and students can follow along visually.
* **Team Workspaces:** Collaborative rooms where multiple students can code simultaneously and view each other's work.
* **Admin Dashboard:** Full control over users, courses, and site-wide settings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** [Your Database, e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL]
* **Authentication:** [Your Auth Method, e.g., JWT, OAuth]
* **Real-time Communication:** [e.g., WebSockets, Socket.IO]

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16 or higher)
* npm / yarn
* [Your Database] installed and running.
* Docker (for code execution sandbox)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the necessary configuration (database connection string, JWT secret, etc.).
    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_database_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    # From the root directory
    npm run dev # (Assuming you have a script to run both client and server concurrently)
    ```
