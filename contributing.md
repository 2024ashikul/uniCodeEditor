# Contributing to CodeSync

First off, thank you for considering contributing to CodeSync. It's people like you that make such a project possible. Your contributions will help create a powerful, free, and open-source tool for students and educators everywhere.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or improving documentation, to submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code.

* **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please create an issue in our issue tracker, providing as much detail as possible.
* **Suggesting Enhancements:** If you have an idea for a new feature, feel free to create an issue to discuss it.
* **Pull Requests:** If you're ready to contribute code, fork the repo and submit a pull request.

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Roadmap: The Path to the Top 1%

To make CodeSync an industry-grade, top-tier project, we are focusing on the following key areas. This roadmap serves as a guide for high-impact contributions.

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Security Hardening

* **Secure Docker Sandbox:** Implement a robust, secure Docker-based environment for code execution. Each user session must have its own isolated container with strict resource limits (CPU, memory, network) and no root access.
* **Container Orchestration:** Integrate Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to manage and scale the execution sandboxes dynamically.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, building, and deployment.
* **Microservices Architecture:** Refactor the backend into microservices (e.g., Auth Service, Grading Service, Workspace Service) for better scalability and maintainability.
* **Advanced Logging & Monitoring:** Integrate tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack for comprehensive application monitoring and log analysis.
* **Security Auditing:** Implement automated dependency scanning (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk) and regular static/dynamic security analysis.

### Phase 2: Advanced Assessment & Grading

* **Multi-Language Support:** Expand the code runner to support more languages (e.g., Java, C/C++, Python, JavaScript).
* **Custom Test Cases:** Allow teachers to create complex, multi-stage assignments with both visible (for students) and hidden (for grading) test cases.
* **Plagiarism Detection:** Integrate a plagiarism detection engine (like MOSS) to compare submissions against each other and against a web index.
* **Code Quality Metrics:** Automatically grade code based on quality metrics: linting errors, cyclomatic complexity, and adherence to style guides.
* **Manual Grading UI:** Develop an interface for instructors to manually review code, add inline comments, and override automated grades.
* **Peer Review System:** Implement a feature allowing students to review and provide feedback on each other's code.

### Phase 3: Specialized Lab Environments

* **Operating Systems (OS) Lab Module:**
    * **Web-based Terminal:** Provide full terminal access to the sandboxed container.
    * **Virtual File System:** A GUI to explore and manage files within the container.
    * **Process Management:** Assignments involving creating, managing, and tracing system calls for processes (e.g., using `strace`).
* **Networking Lab Module:**
    * **Virtual Network Creator:** Allow teachers to define topologies using `docker-compose` templates (e.g., a client, a server, a router).
    * **Packet Analyzer:** A web-based tool to capture and inspect network traffic within the virtual network (a simplified Wireshark).
    * **Socket Programming:** Assignments for building clients, servers, and simple network protocols.
* **Database (DB) Lab Module:**
    * **Integrated SQL/NoSQL Client:** A web-based client to interact with a database instance (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) running in the sandbox.
    * **Schema & Query Assignments:** Tasks for database design, query writing, and optimization.
    * **State Management:** Ensure each student gets a clean, reset database instance for their session.

### Phase 4: User Experience & Collaboration

* **Real-time Collaborative Terminal:** In addition to the code editor, allow users in a workspace to share a terminal session.
* **Audio/Video Integration:** Integrate WebRTC for optional audio/video chat within collaborative workspaces.
* **Session Playback:** Allow teachers to record a collaborative session and play it back to review a student's problem-solving process.
* **Full Internationalization (i18n):** Support multiple languages for the entire user interface.
* **Accessibility (a11y):** Ensure the platform is fully compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
* **Extensible Theming:** Support for user-selectable themes (e.g., dark/light mode) and custom styling.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples and the `README.md` to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
